# Superpower, Sidekick and Villain Generator

## Overview

*The code chooses for you randomly a **superpower**, a **sidekick** and a **villain**. Will you be able to defeat your enemy?*

## Project Goals

*To review, strengthen and deepen my knowledge in objects, functions and arrays, in Javascript.*

## Code Details

*By reviewing the code, you will see that we have a **function called superhero** that **returns an object** with information about your superpower, your sidekick and the villain you have to defeat. The object contains four (4) methods: **yourSuperpower()**, **generator()**, **yourSidekick()** and **yourEnemy()**.*

+ **yourSuperpower()** method gives a random superpower from an array with various listed superpowers.

+ **generator** method generates a random sidekick/villain from an array with listed heroes/villains.

+ **yourSidekick()** method uses the generator method to produce a sidekick.

+ **yourEnemy()** method uses the generator method to produce a villain.

> Calling the function superhero and using the methods described above, detailed information about your superpower, your sidekick and villain is returned to the console.

ENJOY!!
